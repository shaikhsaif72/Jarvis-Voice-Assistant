Part	                                    What It Does
speak()	                    Makes Jarvis speak out loud using gTTS + pygame
aiProcess()	                Sends commands to ChatGPT and gets a reply
processCommand()	        Opens Google, Facebook, plays music, reads news, or asks ChatGPT
while True:	                Keeps listening for you to say ‚ÄúJarvis‚Äù
"Jarvis Active..."	        After you say ‚ÄúJarvis‚Äù, it listens to your command
except	                    Handles errors if speech is not clear
